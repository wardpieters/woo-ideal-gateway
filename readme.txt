== Installation ==

The WooCommerce iDEAL Gateway plugin extends WooCommerce with the iDEAL payment method.
To offer the iDEAL payment method to the vistors of your WordPress website you also require [WooCommerce](https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to be installed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Support =
If you have any problem with this plugin don't hesitate to open a topic over [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-ideal-gateway). I will reply as soon as possible.

= Why won't the money go directly to my bank account? =
According to iDEAL's requirements, the money can only go to business accounts. PSPs (Payment Service Providers) who offer C2C (Customer-to-Customer) payments must first hold the money. Stripe is a PSP and holds your money first in a German bank account. Depending on your payout settings, the money will be transferred to you daily/weekly/monthly, but the money you earn today will not be transferred in less than 5 business days.

Stripe works with a German payment provider and therefore the money goes to a German bank account, but customers will see your companies' name on their bank statement.

If you make a refund from the Stripe dashboard, people will see your companies' name on their bank statements.

= Why are my customers getting two mails short after each other? =
When a customer places an order, the order is put on-hold until WooCommerce receives a webhook event or by checking when a customer is being redirected to the webshop. So the first mail they get is from the order being put on-hold and the second one is from the order status being updated to either failed or processing.
If you want to disable this, you can simply disable on-hold mails in the WooCommerce mail settings.

= What does my error code mean? =

*	001: The provided Stripe source does not equal the source of the order
*	002: The Stripe source is not chargeable at this time
*	003: The Stripe source is not paid
